; AUTHOR NOTE:
; Zenimax does not properly support Addon development nor do they properly document, or advertise, 
; their API changes and patches. We can only work with the tools that we are given. If something breaks 
; it is likely due to something ZOS did that we need to adjust the code in response to. Give us time 
; and we'll do it. We apologize for the inconvenience that this will cause you but ultimately it's out of our hands.

; We develop these addons in our free time. We have full time day jobs, also have families, kids and 
; pets. We do not create addons for the purpose of being paid. However, tossing us a few bones eases 
; the stress and frustration after endless hours of "code grinding" because it adds to that feeling of 
; work "paying off". It also helps to say we make money on this when the significant others ask why 
; we spend so much time doing it!

; If you like what you see and want more of it, feel free to donate. Lack of donations will certainly 
; not stop us from doing what we do. However, a flood of donations would certainly shift priorities; 
; the choice is yours. Our primary hope is that you enjoy our work as much as we do.
